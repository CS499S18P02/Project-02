      <h3 style="color:#5499C7">Effort and size estimation</h3>
    <div class="require" style= "color:#0E6655">
      <p> &emsp; Several requirements are functionality improvements and features that will take some time to complete, but are rather straightforward. The Bulk
        of the time spent on this project will be spent on the back end to make this website usable for the customer. The customer understands that we
        are not full time employees and they relize the limitations of what can be done in one semester. However, our team is striving to make a website
        that will work far better than it has before and to improve the overall quality and usability of the website. With this said, the effort required
        for this project will be managable.
      </p>
      <h5>Size Estimation</h5>
      <p> &emsp; Our group believes the estimated size for this project will be around <b>3500-4000 lines of code</b>.
      Our criteria for this estimation is including the number of lines of code we will be writing to include additional features as well as expanding old
      ones. This also includes the number of lines we will have to clean up, or fix from what we are given at the beginning of this project, as many of them
      are messy and inconsistent.</p>
