        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11
      </header>
      <p>This week was the week of making sure I had everything setup correctly for the project. First I had to connect to my project team with the platforms
      set up by the team leader. These included Slack, Trello, and Discord. After I got access to the GitHub repository, I downloaded and set up the open-source editor Atom.
      I connected this editor to the GitHub repository so that I could work on the class site directly from there. I then worked on the Requirements page on the class website,
      where I made a list of the requirements in priority order. The stretch goals for the project will be added once those are verified. At the time of this weekly update I am
      currently setting up the project site and making sure I have that configured correctly to be able to run and work on it next week.</p>
