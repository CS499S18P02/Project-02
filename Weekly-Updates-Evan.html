        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11
      </header>
      <p>This week was the week of making sure I had everything setup correctly for the project. First I had to connect to my project team with the platforms
      set up by the team leader. These included Slack, Trello, and Discord. After I got access to the GitHub repository, I downloaded and set up the open-source editor Atom.
      I connected this editor to the GitHub repository so that I could work on the class site directly from there. I then worked on the Requirements page on the class website,
      where I made a list of the requirements in priority order. The stretch goals for the project will be added once those are verified. At the time of this weekly update I am
      currently setting up the project site and making sure I have that configured correctly to be able to run and work on it next week.</p>

        Week 2: 2/12 - 2/18
      </header>
      <p>
        This week I finished setting up the project site and configuring it correctly as well as getting it set up through my Integrated Development Environment using a remote
        package that allowed me to access the class site and work on it locally then save those changes to the actual website. After I got that set up I started working on the
        progress bar for the registration process on the project site. I changed some of the details that the customer wanted changed about it and then optimized the percentage
        updated from referencing progression of the pages to refererencing the progression of the fields the user can fill in. I also animated the progress bar to look more
        appealing to the user. After this I worked on the effort and estimation part of the requirements page on the class website. I included information regarding the effort
        our group is striving to put into this project and then the estimated number of lines with a reason for that estimation.

        Week 3: 2/19 - 2/25
      </header>
      <p>This week I worked on a couple of things. The first thing that I worked on was the character limits for text fields throughout the project site. I went through and
         added these character limits will referencing a guide called the "Salesforce Field Reference Guide". This was to add uniformity to the website and to have the limits at
         the correct standard. The next thing I did was add a dropdown menu for the State option in the profile page instead of just a text field. The drop down menu works better
         than the text field and is in line with the dropdown menu on the user registration page. I tried to make the new drop down menu have the default value as what the user
         input for the registration page, but I did not get this accomplished this week. I also cleaned up some code in a few of the project files. So, next week I will be fixing
         those issues with the drop down menu and cleaning up that code.</p>

        Week 4: 2/26 - 3/4
      </header>
      <p>This week I was working on fixing the issues with the dropdown menu I had last week and I was preparing for the presentation. I worked on the issue and with some help I
    was able to fix this and finish the implementation of the drop down menu. Since I did not work on setting up the database for the project, I spent some time trying to get
    more familiar with that. I also started preparing for the presentation for the class and the meeting with presentation U. I am running a demo on the website to show the user
    registration process, since most of my work on the website was on the registration pages. I made sure that everything was working well and I went through it several times to
    find the best way to run through the registration pages. After we met with Presentation U, I practiced the tips that they suggested to improve the presentation. Next week
    will be the midterm presentation and I plan on documenting parts of the project on the class website next week. </p>
