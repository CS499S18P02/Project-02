        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11

      <p>This week was the week of making sure I had everything setup correctly for the project. First I had to connect to my project team with the platforms
      set up by the team leader. These included Slack, Trello, and Discord. After I got access to the GitHub repository, I downloaded and set up the open-source editor Atom.
      I connected this editor to the GitHub repository so that I could work on the class site directly from there. I then worked on the Requirements page on the class website,
      where I made a list of the requirements in priority order. The stretch goals for the project will be added once those are verified. At the time of this weekly update I am
      currently setting up the project site and making sure I have that configured correctly to be able to run and work on it next week.</p>

        Week 2: 2/12 - 2/18

      <p>
        This week I finished setting up the project site and configuring it correctly as well as getting it set up through my Integrated Development Environment using a remote
        package that allowed me to access the class site and work on it locally then save those changes to the actual website. After I got that set up I started working on the
        progress bar for the registration process on the project site. I changed some of the details that the customer wanted changed about it and then optimized the percentage
        updated from referencing progression of the pages to refererencing the progression of the fields the user can fill in. I also animated the progress bar to look more
        appealing to the user. After this I worked on the effort and estimation part of the requirements page on the class website. I included information regarding the effort
        our group is striving to put into this project and then the estimated number of lines with a reason for that estimation.
