        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11
      </header>
      <p>This week was the week of making sure I had everything setup correctly for the project. First I had to connect to my project team with the platforms
      set up by the team leader. These included Slack, Trello, and Discord. After I got access to the GitHub repository, I downloaded and set up the open-source editor Atom.
      I connected this editor to the GitHub repository so that I could work on the class site directly from there. I then worked on the Requirements page on the class website,
      where I made a list of the requirements in priority order. The stretch goals for the project will be added once those are verified. At the time of this weekly update I am
      currently setting up the project site and making sure I have that configured correctly to be able to run and work on it next week.</p>

        Week 2: 2/12 - 2/18
      </header>
      <p>
        This week I finished setting up the project site and configuring it correctly as well as getting it set up through my Integrated Development Environment using a remote
        package that allowed me to access the class site and work on it locally then save those changes to the actual website. After I got that set up I started working on the
        progress bar for the registration process on the project site. I changed some of the details that the customer wanted changed about it and then optimized the percentage
        updated from referencing progression of the pages to refererencing the progression of the fields the user can fill in. I also animated the progress bar to look more
        appealing to the user. After this I worked on the effort and estimation part of the requirements page on the class website. I included information regarding the effort
        our group is striving to put into this project and then the estimated number of lines with a reason for that estimation.

        Week 3: 2/19 - 2/25
      </header>
      <p>This week I worked on a couple of things. The first thing that I worked on was the character limits for text fields throughout the project site. I went through and
         added these character limits while referencing a guide called the "Salesforce Field Reference Guide". This was to add uniformity to the website and to have the limits at
         the correct standard. The next thing I did was add a dropdown menu for the State option in the profile page instead of just a text field. The drop down menu works better
         than the text field and is in line with the dropdown menu on the user registration page. I tried to make the new drop down menu have the default value as what the user
         input for the registration page, but I did not get this accomplished this week. I also cleaned up some code in a few of the project files. So, next week I will be fixing
         those issues with the drop down menu and cleaning up that code.</p>

        Week 4: 2/26 - 3/4
      </header>
      <p>This week I was working on fixing the issues with the dropdown menu I had last week and I was preparing for the presentation. I worked on the issue and with some help I
    was able to fix this and finish the implementation of the drop down menu. Since I did not work on setting up the database for the project, I spent some time trying to get
    more familiar with that. I also started preparing for the presentation for the class and the meeting with presentation U. I am running a demo on the website to show the user
    registration process, since most of my work on the website was on the registration pages. I made sure that everything was working well and I went through it several times to
    find the best way to run through the registration pages. After we met with Presentation U, I practiced the tips that they suggested to improve the presentation. Next week
    will be the midterm presentation and I plan on documenting parts of the project on the class website next week. </p>

        Week 5 and 6: 3/5 - 3/18
      </header>
      <p>These two weeks were basically wrapping everything up for midterm. I started out week 5 by doing the presentation with my group for the class. I believe we did well on this
      presentation and we showed how much work on the project we have done so far. This was very good practice for the final presentation to the customer. The other thing that I got
      done this week was that I got the Screens section of the class website done. This took longer than I expected to take snippets of the entire website, which I felt was necessary
      for the assignment, but I was able to show all the aspects of the website and explain each on of them affectively. For week 6, I wasn't able to work on the class website or the
      project website because I was exploring Aruba and the Dominican Republic! Our group is excited and ready to work hard after the break to accomplish what the customer wants and to
      finally give them a webite they can use. </p>

      Week 7: 3/18 - 3/25
    </header>
    <p>After a relaxing break we dove into finishing up the project before testing. This week I worked on fixing the problem the customer had with the dropdown menu on our navigation bar
      for our admins. The dropdown menu would redirect the user to the users page if the user clicked on it. So, I looked into it and took out the link it was redirecting the user to.
      That fixed the problem of it redirecting the user, but clicking on the dropdown option on the navigation bar would still refresh the page. So, I found an href command that would disable
      the reloading of the page. Now, the dropdown menu on the navigation bar just opens up the dropdown menu like we wanted. This next week will be a little more involved with setting up
      the testing plan and figuring out exactly who will be testing what. </p>

    Week 8: 3/25 - 4/1
  </header>
  <p> This week I focused on getting us started with our testing plan. I went through and looked at all the information given over testing during lecture and I then looked at many of the
      examples given. I then developed a brief over view of the testing we should do for the remainder of the semester. For the Unit Testing section I figured we could test the specific
      parts of each page of the website. This will catch many of the independent errors found in the website. For the next section we have to be more thorough, since this section deals with
      the overall functionality of the website. This will tell us if we met all the requirements of our customer. The next section of testing was systems testing with we will more than likely
      only get to testing Google Chrome. The browser we have been working with so far. We may get to test other browsers, but the customer didn't specify any so will will get to any additional
      browsers last. And lastly the customer has been good and will be good about giving us feedback and testing the project after we are finished testing. So, this week I started the testing
      plan and next week I plan on refining this plan and drawing up some tables for testing use. </p>

  Week 9: 4/2 - 4/8
</header>
<p>  This week I was very busy with tests and other classes. However, in preparation for the code review I felt it necessary to go through and document the code that I worked on for this
project thus far. I only added in minor information to those files just so we could better navigate through them during the code review. This information included things such as what those
specific sections of code in the file did. Over the course of this next week I will have more time to add in more descriptions for the entire files I mainly worked on as well as more testing
and documentation for the project. This will help our group finish up for the semester and then get into practicing for our final project presentation.</p>
