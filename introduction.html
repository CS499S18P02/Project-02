    <div class="description" style="width:50rem">
      <p>We will be working with Software testing and Quality Assurance (SQS) on a website
        that they use for training new employees. The site needs to have built in vulnerabilites
        and be error prone, as the trainees will be looking for these and reporting them through
        the appropriate channels at SQS.</p>

      <p>This will serve as a training tool for new employees to try and find the vulnerabilities
        that are set on the user account. The employees will write scripts that will run through the
        site to find each error that is set up for the user.</p>
