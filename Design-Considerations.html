    <h1><u>Design Considerations</u></h1>
    <h3>Issues</h3>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Dump Files Incorrectly formatted</p></li>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Starting out, we had to download the previos groups work and install it on our server from Namecheap.
              This proved to be more difficult than originally thought because of the incorrect formatting of the SQL
              dump files that we were given. When we tried to load them into our Database the files came back with many errors.
            </p></li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        <li><p>Poorly Structed Database</p></li>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Another big portion of redesign was the database and the database structure. The database structure that we were
              given was incorrectly formatted and had redundent fields. Going through and figuring out what was need and not needed
              was needed in the beginning so we could start with a good backbone.
            </p></li>
          </ul><br>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Changes to Design</h3>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Non-Working Feature Loader</p></li>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Halfway though the project, we realized the feature was in a non working state. This had to be redesigned because the original
            method was not a good way for implementation.
          </p></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Restrictions</h3>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Dynamically Refreshing the page</p></li>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The customer wanted a feature that would refresh a users page if the ddatabse changed for that user.
            Meaning if a feature was added or deleted from the user or if the user was added or removed to or from a group the
            users page would refresh and show the new feature that were assigned. We were unable to get this done as no one on the
            team had much experience with this and we were unable to finish that feature before the end of the semester
          </p></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </ul>
    </div>
