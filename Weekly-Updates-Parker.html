      <p>After joining all of the appropriate communication channels (trello, slack, etc.) provided by Madison, my first task was to get one of the older iterations
      of our project live on to an actual domain so that it would be easier for our customer to view our progress. To do this, I first set up a new database on a web
      sever that Zack and I own and then proceeded to populate the database using the sql files given to us by the client from our first meeting. Once this was accomplished,
      I then created a new FTP directory on our server and purchased a new domain <a href="http://sqstraining.tech">sqstraining.tech</a>. After testing and making sure the new
      domain had the appropriate DNS settings to route to my new directory, I uploaded all of the current files for the site that were given to us from a previous group into
      the newly made folder. Finally, I modified the files that were being used to connect to the database so that it would connect properly with the one I made on our server
      (changing the db name, user, password, and host). So now our project is currently live and viewable at <a href="http://sqstraining.tech">this</a> location.</p>

        Week 1: 2/12 - 2/18
      </header>
      <p>I started this week by adding bootstrap 4 to the project and fixing all compatibility issues (the old project had an older version). After fixing this and making sure
      the navbar was still functioning, I started restyling the login and registration pages. So throughout this week I worked on the <a href="http://sqstraining.tech/user_login.php">
      login page</a> and the <a href="http://sqstraining.tech/user_register.php">registration page</a>. I also worked on the header.php file to make sure the site would mantain functionality
      under the new framework. I needed to be extensive in making sure none of the new styling would be broken and that a new consistency of styling (for our team) was well established moving
      forward, so this was this last thing I handled for the week.</p>
