        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11
      </header>
      <p>After joining all of the appropriate communication channels (trello, slack, etc.) provided by Madison, my first task was to get one of the older iterations
      of our project live on to an actual domain so that it would be easier for our customer to view our progress. To do this, I first set up a new database on a web
      sever that Zack and I own and then proceeded to populate the database using the sql files given to us by the client from our first meeting. Once this was accomplished,
      I then created a new FTP directory on our server and purchased a new domain <a href="http://sqstraining.tech">sqstraining.tech</a>. After testing and making sure the new
      domain had the appropriate DNS settings to route to my new directory, I uploaded all of the current files for the site that were given to us from a previous group into
      the newly made folder. Finally, I modified the files that were being used to connect to the database so that it would connect properly with the one I made on our server
      (changing the db name, user, password, and host). So now our project is currently live and viewable at <a href="http://sqstraining.tech">this</a> location.</p>

        Week 2: 2/12 - 2/18
      </header>
      <p>I started this week by adding bootstrap 4 to the project and fixing all compatibility issues (the old project had an older version). After fixing this and making sure
      the navbar was still functioning, I started restyling the login and registration pages. So throughout this week I worked on the <a href="http://sqstraining.tech/user_login.php">
      login page</a> and the <a href="http://sqstraining.tech/user_register.php">registration page</a>. I also worked on the header.php file to make sure the site would mantain functionality
      under the new framework. I needed to be extensive in making sure none of the new styling would be broken and that a new consistency of styling (for our team) was well established moving
      forward, so this was this last thing I handled for the week.</p>

        Week 3: 2/19 - 2/25
      </header>
      <p>I spent most of this week working on the primary functionality that the site still needed which was adding the ability for admins to assign certain features (errors) to either groups
      or individual users. I did this by adding the "Assign Features" page to where now admins can view, add, and delete current assignments to both groups and individual users. This task
      was quite involved and included a decent amount of backend (database) work, testing, and front end work to complete. Despite this, I still managed to get two other smaller things
      knocked off our list which included adding a profile picture for users and fixing the navigation dropdown menus to have clickable parent links. All in all, these were the 3 main tasks
      that I was able to handle for this week.</p>

        Week 4: 2/26 - 3/4
      </header>
      <p>For this week, I spent most of my time handling various assignments that were left on our trello board. The main difficult functionality that needed to get done for this week was
      adding in the ability for a user to edit, add, and delete phone numbers from the profile page. Once I finished this functionality and confirmed through several tests that it was good
      to go, I then worked on adding a progress bar to the profile page. I added this bar to show the user how many fields are not filled out which could mean they are either blank, NULL,
      or nothing has been added to them (in the case for the skills and phone numbers). After I got this progress bar working, I then added it to the users page (for admins) so that admins
      could view the current profile progress of any given user. The last thing I did for this week, other than preparing for our presentation, was modifying the edit user modal on the users
      page while also adding a delete user option.</p>

        Week 5: 3/5 - 3/11
      </header>
      <p>Since this was the week of midterms, I spent most of this week just doing minor touch ups and backend work. For example I did a lot of tweaking to the admin_user_info page like adding
      in the delete functionality while also fixing the edit functionality. The edit functionality still needs a bit more work done but you can now at least edit any user's basic info. I also did
      a bit more backend work on the user_features page to ensure a more concise and consistent functionality. There wasn't a whole lot more left to handle other than minor touch ups because we
      were still waiting on a reply from the customer regarding a few questions we had on the remaining goals/stretch goals. They did reply during this week so I will be able to knock out a lot
      more the week after our break.</p>

        Week 7: 3/19 - 3/25
      </header>
      <p>I spent this week setting up all of the user permissions. The customer sent us a response to one of our messages describing in detail what all of the different user levels were and what
      permissions each user level had. So I went ahead and made all of the backend and frontend adjustments necessairy to fulfill all of the customer's requirements. The 4 main users are now
      Restricted Users, Users, Super Users, and Admins. Restricted users are users who can access the site with the loaded in bugs but cannot turn on/off those bugs. They can also view what group
      they are in but are unable to see who else is in that group. Users are almost the same as Restricted users except they can actually view who else is in their group. Super Users have all of
      the previous features of a User but are also able to assign people to groups or create new groups. Lastly, Admins have all the previous features of a Super User with the additional ability
      to turn on/off particular bugs for certain users.</p>

        Week 8: 3/26 - 4/1
      </header>
      <p>Our project is getting closer and closer to being completely finsished so I spent this week working on a few odds and ends that were still in our To Do column on trello. One of the main
      items that I handled was a password reset functionality. So this essentially involved setting up a password reset page where the user could type in their email and promptly get a custom
      link for resetting their password (provided the email could be found amongst the list of users). After typing in and confirming their new password the user would then be sent back to the
      main login page where their new password should work. I also worked on a few minor style changes. For example, I worked a bit on the style of the group page for Users and Restricted Users.
      My goal for next week most likely is to continue off of this work and try and improve style and style consistency across the board for the rest of the site.</p>

        Week 9: 4/2 - 4/8
      </header>
      <p>I spent most of this week just finishing a lot of minor remaining issues/features that the site needed. This particular week, however, was a bit hectic for me so I didn't do a whole lot of
      the remaining items that we had on our trello board. Nevertheless I did get a few things done which is still pretty good considering there isn't really a whole left to do anyways. After handling
      a few of the remaining items, I spent a decent amount of time this weekend trying to help out with whatever was needed on the class specific stuff (commenting, testing, presentation, etc.). Most
      of what I did was commenting all of the files that I changed throughout the project so that future students (or employees at SQS) could see exactly what was done by our team. The last main thing
      that I did was gather all of our information regarding the versions of various platforms that we used to build our project so that our customer can know exactly how to integrate the project into
      their own systems.</p>

        Week 9: 4/9 - 4/15
      </header>
      <p>My main goal for this week was to make sure I was prepared for our practice presentation. I did this by helping with the preperation of slides as well as meeting with my group to discuss who would
      be going over what for the presentation. After the meeting, I started preparing a diagram that I could add to one of my slides which would show a generic schema for our project's database. My team
      also agreed to still include a 60-90 second live demo of our project's main functionalities and wanted me to present it. So I also spent some time going through what functionalities and pages I
      thought would be good for us to highlight while also making sure I had a clear and concise way of going through it all. Once I had a better idea at what I was going to present and how I was going
      to present, I spent a couple hours practicing it while also making any minor edits.</p>
