        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11

      <p>After joining all of the appropriate communication channels (trello, slack, etc.) provided by Madison, my first task was to get one of the older iterations
      of our project live on to an actual domain so that it would be easier for our customer to view our progress. To do this, I first set up a new database on a web
      sever that Zack and I own and then proceeded to populate the database using the sql files given to us by the client from our first meeting. Once this was accomplished,
      I then created a new FTP directory on our server and purchased a new domain <a href="http://sqstraining.tech">sqstraining.tech</a>. After testing and making sure the new
      domain had the appropriate DNS settings to route to my new directory, I uploaded all of the current files for the site that were given to us from a previous group into
      the newly made folder. Finally, I modified the files that were being used to connect to the database so that it would connect properly with the one I made on our server
      (changing the db name, user, password, and host). So now our project is currently live and viewable at <a href="http://sqstraining.tech">this</a> location.</p>

        Week 1: 2/12 - 2/18
      </header>
      <p>I started this week by adding bootstrap 4 to the project and fixing all compatibility issues (the old project had an older version). After fixing this and making sure
      the navbar was still functioning, I started restyling the login and registration pages. So throughout this week I worked on the <a href="http://sqstraining.tech/user_login.php">
      login page</a> and the <a href="http://sqstraining.tech/user_register.php">registration page</a>. I also worked on the header.php file to make sure the site would mantain functionality
      under the new framework. I needed to be extensive in making sure none of the new styling would be broken and that a new consistency of styling (for our team) was well established moving
      forward, so this was this last thing I handled for the week.</p>

        Week 1: 2/19 - 2/25
      </header>
      <p>I spent most of this week working on the primary functionality that the site still needed which was adding the ability for admins to assign certain features (errors) to either groups
      or individual users. I did this by adding the "Assign Features" page to where now admins can view, add, and delete current assignments to both groups and individual users. This task
      was quite involved and included a decent amount of backend (database) work, testing, and front end work to complete. Despite this, I still managed to get two other smaller things
      knocked off our list which included adding a profile picture for users and fixing the navigation dropdown menus to have clickable parent links. All in all, these were the 3 main tasks
      that I was able to handle for this week.</p>

        Week 1: 2/26 - 3/4
      </header>
      <p>For this week, I spent most of my time handling various assignments that were left on our trello board. The main difficult functionality that needed to get done for this week was
      adding in the ability for a user to edit, add, and delete phone numbers from the profile page. Once I finished this functionality and confirmed through several tests that it was good
      to go, I then worked on adding a progress bar to the profile page. I added this bar to show the user how many fields are not filled out which could mean they are either blank, NULL,
      or nothing has been added to them (in the case for the skills and phone numbers). After I got this progress bar working, I then added it to the users page (for admins) so that admins
      could view the current profile progress of any given user. The last thing I did for this week, other than preparing for our presentation, was modifying the edit user modal on the users
      page while also adding a delete user option.</p>
