    <h1<u>Conclusions</u></h1><br>
    <p>Throughout this semester we have learned many different things. Here is a highlight list of some of the things we learned:</p>

    <div class="require">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Team Communication: </b> Working in a group of four was something none of us had done before. We had to work around everyones busy senior schedules
        which meant we had to do a lot of virtual meetings after business hours. Since we did not have an "office" environment we could not see each other working
        during the day or ask questions and get immediate feedback. We utilized slack, discord, and atom to get our work done as a group. These platforms were key
        in successfully getting this project done.</li>

        <li><b>Website Development: </b> Two of our team members had significant experience developing different websites, but the others did not. Coming from a wide
        range of backgrounds meant we really had to depend on eachother to get the project done.</li>

        <li><b>Customer Management: </b> This was the first time that we were all directly responsible for working with a client to deliver a project. As a group we
        had to manage communicating directly with the client on a regular basis and also make sure we understood what they wanted us to produce. We had to decide as
        a group what was feasible to accomplish this semester and let our cliet know what all we would be able to get done for them.</li>
      </ul>
