        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11

      <p> I started off this project with group organization. I set up a trello to keep track of the tasks we need to do along with who needs
          to be doing what. I also set up a slack group that links to our trello and github so when a team member does something the others
          are notified. With a background in graphic design, my main focus is updating the overall appearance of the website, and that is what I
          started with. This week I focused mostly on updating all the fields in the personal profile and fixing their format. I also started to
          update the format of the admin user page. </p>

      <p> This week I wanted to connect with the customer to make sure they had an update and proof of concept. The previous groups they worked with
          left them with a mess, so I wanted them to be able to see we already fixed most of the components that were broken. I am still waiting on a
          response from them, but I did not get the email out until later in the work week so I am not expecting a response until the beginning of the
          work week. I also helped update our class site by created our schedule in a google calendar and embedding it into our site and posting our
          Platforms, Tools, and Languages. </p>

        Week 1: 2/19 - 2/25
      </header>
      <p> The majority of my time this week was spent on administrative duties. I communicated briefly with our customer to check on our progress and
          to give them an opportunity to give us feedback. I also started getting all of our materials ready for the midterm presentation. This consisted
          of scheduling our appointment with presentation U! on friday the second and organizing our materials. I made the powerpoint presentation along
          with an outline for what we will be talking about. In regards to our product for the customer, I updated the home page/text reminder page where
          users can subscribe for updates. </p>

        Week 1: 2/26 - 3/4
      </header>
      <p> This week I was able to finalize our presentation and orgainze our group so that we could go over the topics of the presentation (who did what,
          order of presentation, filling out google doc) as well as practicing the presentation as a whole. I also combed through our customers site and
          made sure that the style was consistant and no spelling/grammatical errors were found. Last for this week, I was able to create a cute little
          animation to apply to the logo on the header by using CSS to rotate the image back and forth.</p>
