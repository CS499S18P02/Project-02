        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11
      </header>
      <p> I started off this project with group organization. I set up a trello to keep track of the tasks we need to do along with who needs
          to be doing what. I also set up a slack group that links to our trello and github so when a team member does something the others
          are notified. With a background in graphic design, my main focus is updating the overall appearance of the website, and that is what I
          started with. This week I focused mostly on updating all the fields in the personal profile and fixing their format. I also started to
          update the format of the admin user page. </p>

        Week 2: 2/12 - 2/18
      </header>
      <p> This week I wanted to connect with the customer to make sure they had an update and proof of concept. The previous groups they worked with
          left them with a mess, so I wanted them to be able to see we already fixed most of the components that were broken. I am still waiting on a
          response from them, but I did not get the email out until later in the work week so I am not expecting a response until the beginning of the
          work week. I also helped update our class site by created our schedule in a google calendar and embedding it into our site and posting our
          Platforms, Tools, and Languages. </p>

        Week 3: 2/19 - 2/25
      </header>
      <p> The majority of my time this week was spent on administrative duties. I communicated briefly with our customer to check on our progress and
          to give them an opportunity to give us feedback. I also started getting all of our materials ready for the midterm presentation. This consisted
          of scheduling our appointment with presentation U! on friday the second and organizing our materials. I made the powerpoint presentation along
          with an outline for what we will be talking about. In regards to our product for the customer, I updated the home page/text reminder page where
          users can subscribe for updates. </p>

        Week 4: 2/26 - 3/4
      </header>
      <p> This week I was able to finalize our presentation and orgainze our group so that we could go over the topics of the presentation (who did what,
          order of presentation, filling out google doc) as well as practicing the presentation as a whole. I also combed through our customers site and
          made sure that the style was consistant and no spelling/grammatical errors were found. Last for this week, I was able to create a cute little
          animation to apply to the logo on the header by using CSS to rotate the image back and forth.</p>

        Week 5: 3/5 - 3/11
      </header>
      <p>This week I did not accomplish much, I had a lot of midterms and not a lot of time. I spent some time getting the group presentation organized
         and worked on the class homework. I will be getting back into the swing of things after spring break because we got feedback from our customer
         and now have a list of things to accomplish.</p>

        Week 6: 3/19-3/25
      </header>
      <p>After the week off for spring break, this week time was spent getting the team back on track and focused on all the things we have left to complete.
         I helped Zack test a couple different parts he updated, like user verification and making sure that the same user can not log on to the site more than
         one session at a time. If they do log in, then the system boots out the oldest occurance of the user and allows the newer occurance to take over. As we
         come to the end stage of this project I will be in charge of making sure all of the testing gets done and with setting up our final presentation so we
         have the images and graphs you want.</p>

        Week 7: 3/26-4/1
      </header>
      <p>This week I focused the majority of my efforts on updating and finalizing the homepage. Our client wanted a video imbeded into their site; they already
         had a video for us to use, we just had to embed it off of youtube and put it on our homepage. I had previously styled the text alert sign up and that was
         all that was originally on the homepage. With the addition of the video, I had to redo the layout to make everything aesthetically pleasing. I made sure
         that the styling was cohesive with the rest of the site. I also gave the header of the webpage an update so the font looked more proportional to the rest
         of the site. Finally, I started adding ID tags to every element per the customer's request, but I still have many more to do.</p>

        Week 8: 4/2-4/8
      </header>
      <p>As the project is very quickly coming to a close, I worked on some of the final feature requests from the customer. The main feature that I added this week
         is the new menu option that takes the user to the SQS homepage (customer's personal site). I added the menu option on the navigation bar and linked it to
         SQS.com. I also have been testing different componets of our testing plan to make sure that everything is functioning how it is supposed to be. The final
         thing I did this week was work on the final presentation so we are prepared for our practice that is coming up.  </p>

        Week 8: 4/9-4/15
      </header>
      <p>The main thing I focused on this week was getting our final presentation put together so we could go over it as a group and decide who would be speaking about what
         and what different componets and images need to be added. We had a group meeting to run through the presentation and the other members helped add imformation to the
         slideshow. I also went through the previous groups version of the project to have some images to compare to our work so others can see the progress that we all made.
         As a group we had a discussion about what all we have left to complete and what our timeline looks like for the last few weeks of the semester. This upcoming week I
         need to finish up ID tags with hunter and we need to work on the class webpage so our final report is finished on time. We also need to finish set up insturctions for
         the customer, but we have made a lot of progress this week and I am excited to practice our final presentation!</p>
