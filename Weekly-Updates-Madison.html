      <p> I started off this project with group organization. I set up a trello to keep track of the tasks we need to do along with who needs
         to be doing what. I also set up a slack group that links to our trello and github so when a team member does something the others
         are notified. With a background in graphic design, my main focus is updating the overall appearance of the website, and that is what I
         started with. This week I focused mostly on updating all the fields in the personal profile and fixing their format. I also started to
         update the format of the admin user page. </p>

      <p> This week I wanted to connect with the customer to make sure they had an update and proof of concept. The previous groups they worked with
          left them with a mess, so I wanted them to be able to see we already fixed most of the components that were broken. I am still waiting on a
          response from them, but I did not get the email out until later in the work week so I am not expecting a response until the beginning of the
          work week. I also helped update our class site by created our schedule in a google calendar and embedding it into our site and posting our
          Platforms, Tools, and Languages. </p>
