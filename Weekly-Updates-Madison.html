        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11
      </header>
      <p> I started off this project with group organization. I set up a trello to keep track of the tasks we need to do along with who needs
         to be doing what. I also set up a slack group that links to our trello and github so when a team member does something the others
         are notified. With a background in graphic design, my main focus is updating the overall appearance of the website, and that is what I
         started with. This week I focused mostly on updating all the fields in the personal profile and fixing their format. I also started to
         update the format of the admin user page.
