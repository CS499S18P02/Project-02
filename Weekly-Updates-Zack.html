        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11
      </header>
      <p>To start off I created the Github Repo and added the team members. I got the class site
          up and running @ <a href="https://cs499s18p02.github.io/">https://cs499s18p02.github.io/</a> and completed the index page. Once the
          database was up on the server, I started work on the SQS prject site. First, I fixed a bug that prevented logging
          into the site. After being able to login, I was able to clean up the code on the Admin User Page and was able to make the
          page look a lot cleaner by adding a pop up modal and taking away some features to add to other pages. </p>

        Week 2: 2/12 - 2/18
      </header>
      <p>This week I was able to work on a few pages. First I worked on the groups code and cleaned up the code that the previous groups
          made. After, I cleaned the code on the Profile Page and made it all one form. Doing this I added 1 edit and 1 save button.
          and made the profile save function work. Which leads into the last section of this weeks progress. I completely redid the save profile file
          to work with the new profile page that Madison Bartlett designed.</p>

        Week 3: 2/19 - 2/25
      </header>
      <p>This week my main focus was to redo the functionality of Software and Hardware skills that each user has. First, Instead of radio boxes
        for selecting the skills, I switched them to multiple select inputs and using Javascript made buttons in between the skills bank and the user
        applied skills so the user can move skills back and forth. I did this for both the Software and Hardware skills and made it available via
        registration and the profile page. Once this was done I reworked the database to become more efficent for applying skills to users, which made
        it easier to add the multiple select boxes to an admin page so the admin could add and remove skills.</p>

        Week 4: 2/26 - 3/4
      </header>
      <p>This week I started by adding the remove feature to the Admin skills page, as I was unable to finish it the week prior. After finishing this,
         I spruced up the log in and registration pages by adding the SQS logo to the each. I then worked a bit in the database end and deleted the
         table that held emails and add the columns straight to the user. We didn't want the user to be able to have more than one email so a 1-1 relation
         table for this didn't make a lot of sense. The last thing I was able to accomplish this meek was fixing the feature loader. The feature loader
         being the most important part of the site. It loads each of the elements that we allow the admins to break per user.</p>

        Week 5: 3/5 - 3/11
      </header>
      <p>This week I worked on completely rehauling the group functionality. The add the groups page and made it so admins can create groups, remove groups,
         add users to groups remove users from groups and promote/demote them to and from leader. I also redid the datbase end of the feature loader, making
         it more efficent and less confusing by deleting useless columns and simplifying the naming convention. I was also able to give the admin the ability to
         add php files to create errors and download the current php files of the errors.</p>

        Week 7: 3/19 - 3/25
      </header>
      <p>This week I was able to create a table for Sessions so that only one user is able to be signed in at one time. Meaning one active session per user,
         This was specifically asked for by the client. I was able to accomplish this by first inserting the session id and user id in to the session table when a user logs
         in. Then if they try to log in again it will check the database to see they are already logged in and will destroy the first session and created a new one and start it.
         as well as replace the session in the table.</p>

        Week 8: 3/26 - 4/1
      </header>
      <p>This week I worked on getting the database set up so that on insertion of a record to the assigned features table and event would run and update the audit table.
         I was able to run a trigger on the insertion and run rules based on that trigger. I then worked on getting it set up so that if a user's features were updated,
         The webpage would auto refresh and run the new features added to the user. The customer has asked for this specifically because they want to be able to add features
         while the user is logged in and for them to be able to see those new features with having to manually refresh or even know they have been added. </p>
