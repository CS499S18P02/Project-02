        Week 1: 2/5 - 2/11

      <p>To start off I created the Github Repo and added the team members. I got the class site
          up and running @ <a href="https://cs499s18p02.github.io/">https://cs499s18p02.github.io/</a> and completed the index page. Once the
          database was up on the server, I started work on the SQS prject site. First, I fixed a bug that prevented logging
          into the site. After being able to login, I was able to clean up the code on the Admin User Page and was able to make the
          page look a lot cleaner by adding a pop up modal and taking away some features to add to other pages. </p>
